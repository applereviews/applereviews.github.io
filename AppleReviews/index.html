    			<h5>is the new iPhone 13 worth the buy?</h5>
    		</a>
    		<p>The new <b>iPhone 13</b> looks pretty similar to its predecesor the iPhone 12 but the newly incorporated <i>Promotion</i> technology and its improved battery life make it a tempting upgrade option. Let's have a look at its specs compared to the iPhone 12's:</p>

    				<h5>The new Apple Watch Series 7 is quite disappointing</h5>
    			</a>
    			<p>The new Apple Watch Series 7 is an entire disappointment. The watch is just an Apple Watch 6S with a larger and more resistant screen. Perhaps, the biggest disappointment is the lack of an upgrade to the battery life, which currently only lasts "18 hours". Another disappointment is the one regarding the lack of a better sleep tracking capability, which the competition has been offering for quite a while; not to mention that the watch didn't get and updated chip. So, after all this, what is the incentive to current Apple Watch owners to upgrade or not owners to get one?</p>

    			</a>
    			<p>The M1 chips allow the new Macbooks Pro, Macbooks Air and 24' iMac to replicate iPhone and iPad apps. In addition, this chip also allows the Macs to obtain a much better battery life and general performance.</p>
