            <h5>The new Apple Watch Series 7 is quite disappointing</h5>
          <p>The new Apple Watch Series 7 is an entire disappointment. The watch is just an Apple Watch 6S with a larger and more resistant screen. Perhaps, the biggest disappointment is the lack of an upgrade to the battery life, which currently only lasts "18 hours". Another disappointment is the one regarding the lack of a better sleep tracking capability, which the competition has been offering for quite a while; not to mention that the watch didn't get and updated chip. So, after all this, what is the incentive to current Apple Watch owners to upgrade or not owners to get one?</p>
